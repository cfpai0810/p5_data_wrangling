# Data Wrangling_WeRateDog
## by Chun-Feng Pai


## Dataset

> There are three different data sources in this project. One is saved as csv file, the other one is scrapped from the internet, and the third source is retrieved through twitter API.


## Summary of Findings

> Our data first shows Puppo is the highest-rated dog stage in this dataset. Then we also
see how favorite counts are distributed in our dataset. The distribution is right-skewed,
meaning the majority of dogs receive fewer likes. One last interesting thing we find in this dataset is the positive correlation between favorite counts and retweet. This finding is also logic and serves as a good indication on how many retweets a dog will receive given
how many retweet would be received. We can simply build a regression model for our
prediction.
